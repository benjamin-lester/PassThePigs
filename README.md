# PassThePigs
Simulation for the popular children's game that involves several rolling pigs
# How to play
Download and compile the solution. We promise, it's snout-rageously fun!
# Rules of the game
Select two pigs. Roll them. Count your score. Pass the pigs when you're ready. (But beware - every next roll is a gamble!)
# Winning the game
First person to score and pass on 100 or greater points initiates a "victory lap" in which every remaining player continues to roll 
  until they either pig out, oinker, or voluntarily pass. If they score above the previous highest scorer's total, they are the new highest scorer.
  Once the final round of rolling is complete, the highest scorer has won!

But watch out for the infamous oinker roll! If your pigs are touching, that's an oinker.
